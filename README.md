# NumberGuesserGame1

This C# program implements a number guessing game where one player sets a secret number, and another player tries to guess it.

The user enters a secret number. It clears the console to hide the secret number. It announces any valid range. The player guesses the number. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high, continuing the loop until the correct number is guessed. Once the player guesses the right number, the message is displayed.
